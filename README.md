# RESTful API
This application offer in a web url, an API that can perform CRUD operations in all your tables. It uses the followings frameworks:
<ul>
 <li>Java Spring Boot: To create, and run the API;</li>
 <li>Java Persistence Annotation: To do the database manipulation;</li>
 <li>Lombok: To facilitates the creation of common codes (getters, setters).</li>
</ul>
It uses MySQL as the DBMS.

## Modeling
The application uses the Java Persistence Annotation to do the data base manipulation and the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), the following UML diagrams describe the classes structure and the database modeling.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
In the database scheme, the table "tb_employees" contains a stranger key row to refer the department primary key.
```mermaid
erDiagram
tb_employees {
int id
int department_id
string employee_name
string email
}
tb_departments {
int id
string dep_name
}
tb_employees }o--|| tb_departments : has
```

### Class Diagram
In class scheme, the department is represented as a class aggregated to the class Employee. To do this, an Department object is instantiated within the People object.

```mermaid
classDiagram
Department o-- Employee
class Employee{
-Long id
-String name
String email
-Department department
+Employee()
+Employee(Long id, String name, Department department)
+Employee(String name, Department department)
+getId() Long
+setId()
+getName() String
+setName()
+getEmail() String
+setEmail()
+getDepartment() Department
+setDepartment()
}
class Department{
-Long id
-String name
+Department()
+Department(Long id, String name)
+getId() Long
+setId()
+getName() String
+setName()
}
```

## How to run?

<ol>
	<li>To run this application, you need to open a MySQL connection in the port 3030 on your localhost and create a database called "restful_api_demo".</li>
	<li>Clone the project to your directory:  <code>git clone https://github.com/kdukoelho/demo-restful-api.git</code></li>
	<li>Run the DemoRestfulApiApplication.java, located in <code>src/main/java/com/rabbit/demorestfulapi/DemoRestfulApiApplication.java"</code></li>
</ol>

After that the API will be available in the URL: <b>http://localhost:8080/peoples</b>.

## Operations
 It is possible to perform CRUD operations in all the tables.


### CREATE
To insert an employee send a POST signal and pass in the body of the request in JSON format: the name, email, and department (As described in class diagram). Look at the following example: 
<pre><code>
{
	"peopleName": "Carlos Cl√©rio da Silva",
	"email": "carlos_clerio@yahoo.com.br",
	"department": {
		"id": 1,
		"depName": "Development"
	}
}
</code></pre>
If its work, the response will be the new employee data.
### READ

To read, there are two methods.
<ol>
	<li>GetEmployeeList: Just send a GET signal to http://localhost:8080, this will return the data of tb_employees in JSON format.</li>
	<li>GetEmployeeById: Send a GET signal to http://localhost:8080/{id}, this will return the data of the referred id located in tb_employees.</li>
</ol>

### UPDATE
To update a employee, send a POST signal to http://localhost:8080/{id}, where the id is the identification of the desire employee, and pass in the body of the request in JSON format: the name, email, and department. If its work, the response will be the employee new data.

### DELETE

To delete an employee, send a DELETE signal to http://localhost:8080/{id}, where the id is the identification of the desire employee. If its work, the response will be a string confirming that.
